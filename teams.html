<button class="accordion">U6 Development Squad</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>At Hart FC our aim within the U6’s is to create a friendly, safe and fun environment for the children to enjoy training sessions focusing on the FUNdamentals of football and Agility, Balance and coordination.</p>
  <p>Players train each week until they reach year 2 at school, when they will then have the opportunity to join a league with their Hart FC team mates.</p>
  <p>We welcome new players and train weekly on a Saturday between 2-3pm at Ancells Farm Park playing fields. (September through until May) – We realise children this age could potentially be trying football for the first time and for this reason the first 2 taster sessions are free of charge before you decide whether to register and sign up your child into Hart Youth FC.</p>
